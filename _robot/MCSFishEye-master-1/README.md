## How To Use

Checkout demo project for some real life action!

### Instantiating

Setup a `dataSource`, an optional `delegate`, add subview and you're done

```
MCSFishEyeView *fisheye = [[MCSFishEyeView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 50.0f, 600.0f)];  
fisheye.dataSource = self;
fisheye.delegate = self;
[self.view addSubview:fisheye];
```

### Items

`MCSFishEyeView` has the notion of items, which are more or less similar to table view cells. Each item should be a subclass of `MCSFishEyeViewItem`, as it already provides convinent methods for setting `highlighted` and `selected` state. You register a class to `MCSFishEyeView` by this one-liner:

```
[fisheye registerItemClass:[MCSExampleFishEyeItem class]];
```
Inside your custom `MCSFishEyeViewItem` subclass you are free to do whatever you want in both
 
 `- (void)setSelected:(BOOL)selected animated:(BOOL)animated` 
 
and

`- (void)setHighlighted:(BOOL)highlighted animated:(BOOL)animated`

methods, just make sure you call `super` (don't worry, compiler will warn you if you forget to do so).

### States

`MCSFishEyeView` has three different states:



- `MCSFishEyeStateCollapsed` - in this state all the items are collapsed, no item is `highlighted` or `selected`

- `MCSFishEyeStateExpandedActive` - items are moving around according to touch location, at most one element is `highlighted`, no elements are `selected`

- `MCSFishEyeStateExpandedPassive` - in this state a single item is standing out in `selected` state, all the other items are collapsed
